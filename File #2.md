* I had forgotten to email my Github username to Prof. Gil and so I was unable to clone the class site locally. 

* HTML: I have some experience with HTML and I know that you can use HTML in Markdown, but you can't use Markdown in HTML. I was unsure if using both would cause issues on github, so even though I **really** wanted to use HTML throughout I mostly abstained.

* Footnotes: Figuring out how to use footnotes took me the longest amount of time. I didn't like how the footnotes appeared using [^1] so I used examples of both Markdown and HTML to format it the way I found visually appealing. I wasn't able to find an equivalent only in Markdown.

* Images: This part was easy, but I had to do a little bit of research to figure out how to resize the image.
